# console-trace

Extends the native Node.JS `console` object to prefix logging functions
with the [CallSite](http://github.com/visionmedia/callsite) information.

To read more about runtime stack trace introspection you can refer to [this
article](http://www.devthought.com/2011/12/22/a-string-is-not-an-error/#beyond).

## How to use

```js
require('console-trace')
```

You can add the `t` or `traced` getter to your calls to obtain a stacktrace:

```js
console.t.log('a');
console.traced.log('a');
```

You can also make every console call trace:

```js
console.traceAlways = true;
```

To disable colors completely, set the following:

```js
console.traceColors = false;
```

To customize the string that's prefixed to the calls, override the
`console.traceFormat` function.

## Beyond console

If you have more sophisticated logging needs, or don't wish to extend
`console`, I suggest you look at [tracer](https://github.com/baryon/tracer).
